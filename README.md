* SAVE CHANGES: save only the fully working feature that is completed

Android Studio -> Git -> commit    commit ... commit
Android Studio -> Git -> push      commit ... commit

* SUBSEQUENT USE: it is a good habit to pull any changes to the repo made by other users, before starting to work on a new feature:

Android Studio -> Git -> Pull...

If you have done some work and meantime, someone added a feature, that you have not pulled yet, make sure to save your work in a COPY file for your records for safety.
Sometimes when pulling changes, there might be merge problems that you can either try to resolve, or best if you COPY your entire project first, then try to rebase onto remote changes.
This way in the original project that you have open you will discard your work and get the current repo state, but because you copied the project you would be able to
manually re-apply your work (copy-paste) into the original project.

If in doubt, contact your project leader .
